# SAO UI Patch
This mod is my first ASM bytecode manipulation. The purpose of the mod is to fix
some things in latest dev build of SAO UI (1.6.0 for 1.7.10). Here are features:
- Fix crash on logout
- Fire pre overlay render for other mods compatibility
- Remove dev build notice as it can become annoying
